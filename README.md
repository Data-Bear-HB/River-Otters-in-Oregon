#River Otter Sighting in Oregon using iNaturalist Data#

What: This project was started to create more access for hobby naturalists to observe river otters in Oregon. I also wanted to explore SQLpostgre cleaning and vizualing data techniques. The overall goal is to create a dashboard where someone could search by time of year (and a few other search terms) so they would be more likely to spot otter populations for the pleasure of watching them and for further naturalist learning.

Why: River otters can be shy and hard to spot so creating a dashboard of seasons and locations will increase the likelihood of a naturalist observing them and adding to community knowledge about this species.

From Where: The data in this project came from iNaturalist. I specifically filtered for sightings confirmed with photos and occuring only in Oregon.

2. **Project Findings**

   a.  **"Where in Oregon are the most sightings of river otters (or otter signs)?"
  
  "What time of year do most Oregon naturalists see river otters?"**

b. Other insights: _______________

c. Actionable information: If you're looking to observe river otters, I reccomend looking in bodies of water in _____________ (specific parts of Oregon) with a higher likelihood of spotting otters during ________ (specific times of year). We know that otter populations (more than one otter) were observed in __________ (general location) in the past five years.
